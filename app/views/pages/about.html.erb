<h1><%= @title %> the Helpdesk Ticketing app</h1>
<p>The Helpdesk ticketing app is a tool to help me get familiar with Rails and development.
To a very small degree it's intended ultimately be a functional Ticketing app for a Helpdesk
support environment. Possible future features could include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>User authentication</li>
	<li>Auto-generated email notifications</li>
	<li>time based events</li>
	<li>Search</li>
	<li>Auto complete</li>
	<li>Documentation area/ wiki</li>
</ul>
