Thanks for checking out my Helpdesk app.

Purpose of this application: Teach me a bit about development in general, and Rails development in particular.

What is this supposed to be?

Ultimately, and ideally it's supposed to be a fully functional Helpdesk application with a dual focus on users and devices. 
Most ticketing systems I've encountered have had either a user focus or a device/machine focus. My office likes a bit more flexibility.
Additionally if I'm feeling ambitious I may attempt to include some kind of time tracking, and perhaps even project management. 

As of now, I'm learning entirely on my own with little to no advice from experienced developers.

If you happen to have stumbled across this and have any questions, or help / support, please feel free to contact me.
